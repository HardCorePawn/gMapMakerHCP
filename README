This is a Visual Studio 2008 project for the modified version of gMapMaker (http://www.mgmaps.com/cache/) to download tiles that will work with "Brut" GoogleMaps on AndroidOS.

All credit for this tool goes to the original dev's... I just hacked it so that it will download the tiles in the right format... 

GNU Public License etc etc...


For instructions on how to use the actual application (and a link to a compiled binary for windows):
